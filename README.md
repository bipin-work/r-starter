# React Starter

A scalable skeleton for react project

## API calls

For api calls you can use either axios and hooks or by using React query if caching is priority

## State Management

If possible use ContextAPI, if not use Zustand or Jotai or Redux depending upon the complexity of the project

## Styling

Either use CSS SASS or tailwind

## NOTES

1. Try to make the components as atomic as possible
2. Code splitting wherever necessary
3. Divide the code or make reusable functions hooks wherever necessary. A good convention is that if the codesize is greater than 400 lines, trim it down
4. Use usestate and other hooks properly. Try to memoize values and functions wherever needed
